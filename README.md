# üìä DataGram

**Market Research Data Platform for AI Agents**

---

## üéØ Problem

Traditional market research is:

- üí∏ **Expensive** ‚Äî Analyst-driven studies can cost $10,000+
- üê¢ **Slow** ‚Äî Takes weeks to gather and analyze data
- üéØ **Biased** ‚Äî Often relies on small, B2B-centric samples

---

## üí° Solution

**DataGram** is a decentralized data platform enabling individuals to upload micro-surveys or product feedback and earn per access.  
AI agents use this real-time data to:

- Detect emerging consumer trends
- Summarize market sentiment
- Suggest product improvements

---

## üß™ How It Works

### 1. **Data Contributor**

Users can:
- Fill in-app surveys (e.g., product review forms)
- Submit feedback from platforms like Reddit or Amazon
- Tag entries by product, usage, and demographics

**Example:**
```json
{
  "product": "iPhone 15",
  "likes": ["Camera", "Fast Charging"],
  "dislikes": ["Battery life"],
  "rating": 4,
  "age": 28,
  "region": "California",
  "tags": ["electronics", "apple"]
}
```

---

### 2. **Data Pool**

- Normalized & encrypted feedback
- Indexed by tags (e.g., location, brand, device type)

---

### 3. **AI Agent Queries**

Agents use GraphQL or API to query:

> "Top complaints about Apple products from Gen Z females in California (last 30 days)?"

- Pays per-record in **x402 tokens**
- Returns analysis, reports, design insights

---

### 4. **Earnings Dashboard**

- Contributors receive micro-payouts (e.g., $0.005/read)
- Transparent dashboard for:
  - Total reads
  - Rating impact
  - Earnings history
